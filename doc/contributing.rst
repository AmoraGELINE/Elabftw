Contributing to the code
------------------------

* before doing a pull request, open an issue so we can discuss about it (unless it is obvious that your code should be merged ;).
* base your PR on the **next** branch, which is the development branch; **master** being the *release* branch.
* most of the code is procedural, but a progressive transition to object oriented code is on the way.
* classes should be in `inc/classes` with namespace Elabftw\\Elabftw
* a new class will be loaded automagically thanks to the use of PSR-4 with composer
* for i18n, we use gettext
* if you change a string in gettext _('they look like this'), change it also in a .po file (generally the french one) and generate a .mo file (with poedit)
* same if you add a string shown to the user, it needs to be gettexted
* if you make a change to the SQL stucture, you need to put it in `update.php` and also `install/elabftw.sql`
* the `update.php` script is sequential. So add a block of code before the END comment. Make a check to see if you need to alter something, and if yes, do it.
* most of the functions are in `inc/functions.php`
* you can use the constant ELAB_ROOT (which ends with a /) to have a full path
* comment your code wisely
* your code must follow `the PSR standards <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md>`_
* add a plugin to your editor to show trailing whitespaces in red
* add a plugin to your editor to show PSR-1 errors
* remove BOM

API Documentation
-----------------

You can find a PHP Docblock generated documentation on classes `here <../../../doc/api/namespaces/Elabftw.Elabftw.html>`_ (local link).

To generate it: `phpdoc -t doc/api -d inc/classes`

Automation
----------

Since version 1.1.7, elabftw uses `grunt <http://gruntjs.com/>`_ to minify and concatenate files (JS and CSS). Have a look at Gruntfile.js to see what it does. Install grunt-cli and run it if you make changes to any of those files.
Grunt can also be used to build the documentation or run the tests.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ grunt # will minify and concatenate JS and CSS
    $ grunt doc # will build this documentation
    $ grunt api # will build the API documentation
    $ grunt test # will run the tests with codeception

.. note:: You need to have a running `Selenium server <http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/>`_ to do the acceptance tests


Reminders
---------

* update of SwiftMailer and mPDF is done with `composer update`
* update of the js components is done with `bower update`
* after update of tinymce, lang files need to be downloaded again, and the ones without proper name (ca instead of ca_ES) need to be edited (change first line to ca_ES)
* for a new version, one needs to edit inc/classes/Update.php, package.json and doc/conf.py
